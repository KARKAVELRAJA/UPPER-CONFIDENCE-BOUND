# UPPER-CONFIDENCE-BOUND

### IMPLEMENTATION OF ADVERTISEMENT CTR (CLICK-THROUGH RATE) OPTIMIZATION USING UPPER CONFIDENCE BOUND

- UPPER CONFIDENCE BOUND (UCB) is a deterministic algorithm for Reinforcement Learning that focuses on exploration and exploitation based on a confidence boundary that the algorithm assigns to each machine on each round of exploration
- In this project, at first the dataset is loaded and pre-processing steps are carried out
- Then, by using UPPER CONFIDENCE BOUND concept, the pre-processed data are trained
- Finally, the output is visualized
